### Best practices

To ensure consistency and maintain quality, follow these best practices when adding or modifying components:

- Symbols and footprints must be in the official KiCad format (v6+ recommended).
- All names (library items, fields, files) and descriptions must be in English.
- Component outlines should be drawn on the appropriate Fabrication layer (`F.Fab` or `B.Fab`) with accurate dimensions.
- Silkscreen around a component should be spaced at least 0.1 mm from the component's outline on the `F.Fab`/`B.Fab` layer.
- If a variant of a component is needed, it should be named `<component_name>_<variant_suffix>`, where the suffix describes the variant (e.g., `nSilk` for no silkscreen, `sqSilk` for square silkscreen).
- Use `REF**` as the default reference designator in symbols.
- Validate symbols and footprints with KiCad's built-in tools before adding them.
